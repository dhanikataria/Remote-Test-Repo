# Python Algorithm for breaking the Encryption of data using Differential Analysis

- This is a algorithm in python which performs encryption and decryption functions using block ciphers. 
- The algorithm also performs differential analysis on the cipher to determine the sub-key bits (breaking encryption) for the encryption
